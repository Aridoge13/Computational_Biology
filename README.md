# Computational Biology Beginner Projects

## Description
This project is your all-in-one toolkit for tackling the wild world of bioinformatics. Whether you're counting codons, translating DNA, aligning sequences, or hunting for promoter motifs, we've got a script for that. Think of it as your Swiss Army knife for genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data analysis‚Äîbut with more Python and fewer pocket knives.

From codon usage to variant annotation, these scripts are here to make your research life easier, faster, and maybe even a little fun. So grab your lab coat, fire up your terminal, and let‚Äôs dive into the data!

## What's Inside? 
Here‚Äôs a quick tour of the scripts you‚Äôll find in the src folder:

1. codon_analysis.py: Count codons like a pro and visualize their usage. Because codons deserve to be counted too. 
2. dna-protein.py: Translate DNA into protein sequences in all three reading frames. It‚Äôs like Google Translate, but for genomes. 
3. gc_calc.py: Calculate GC content because someone has to keep track of all those Gs and Cs. 
4. gc_calc_pwa.py: GC content + pairwise alignment = double the fun! 
5. phylogenetic_analysis.py: Build phylogenetic trees and pretend you‚Äôre Darwin for a day. 
6. promoter_id.py: Hunt for promoter motifs like TATA boxes and GC-rich regions. It‚Äôs a treasure hunt, but for DNA! 
7. protein_property.py: Calculate molecular weight, pI, and hydrophobicity. Because proteins have feelings too. 
8. protein_seq_motif.py: Find protein motifs and feel like a bioinformatics detective. 
9. rna_analysis.py: Analyze RNA-Seq data and visualize differentially expressed genes. 
10. seq_align_score_calc.py: Align sequences like a boss with Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms. üß¨‚öîÔ∏è
11. variant_annotation.py: Call and annotate variants like a genomic detective. 


## Why use these scripts? 

- They‚Äôre fun: Who said bioinformatics had to be boring? 
- They‚Äôre functional: From codon counting to tree building, these scripts have you covered. 
- They‚Äôre free: Because science should be accessible (and I'm nice like that). 


## How to get started
- Open the src folder.
- Run the scripts and let the magic happen. 
- Thank me later. (Or now, if you wish to. I'm not that picky.)


## Disclaimer
While these scripts are designed to make your life easier, they cannot (yet) make coffee, write your thesis, or explain why your PCR failed. Use responsibly. Have fun.
