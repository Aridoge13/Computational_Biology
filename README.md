## üìò Description
This repository provides a curated collection of Python-based tools for common tasks in **computational biology and regulatory genomics**, designed for researchers analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and evolutionary data. The scripts are modular, well-documented, and suited for mutation analysis, sequence evolution studies, and motif detection ‚Äî with direct relevance to investigating the origins and dynamics of regulatory RNA elements.

Originally built to support graduate-level research in genomics and machine learning, this toolkit can be used for both educational and research applications involving **mutation clusters, RNA gene emergence**, and **comparative genomics**.

## üß™ Project Features
### Core Functionalities

- **DNA/RNA sequence analysis**: Translate, compare, and characterize raw nucleotide sequences  
- **Regulatory motif detection**: Identify promoter motifs or codon usage patterns  
- **Phylogenetic modeling**: Construct and analyze evolutionary trees  
- **Mutation & variant annotation**: Detect and annotate clustered or somatic mutations  
- **RNA-seq data processing**: Visualize expression and functional divergence  
- **Metagenomic analysis**: Profile community-wide diversity and function

### Workflow Overview
> The tools in this repository are designed to be modular, but can also be used in sequence as part of a complete analysis workflow. Below is an example of how these components may integrate in a mutation- or expression-driven research pipeline:
