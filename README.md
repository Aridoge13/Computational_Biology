# Computational Biology Beginner Projects

## Description
This project provides a set of Python scripts for analyzing nucleotide sequences, focusing on codon usage, GC content calculation, and sequence alignment. It is designed to assist in bioinformatics research and genomic data analysis.

## Features
- Feature codon_analysis.py for codon analysis
    - Reads DNA sequences from a FASTA file.
    - Counts codon usage frequency.
    - Visualizes codon distribution using a bar chart.

- Feature gc_calc_pwa.py for calculating GC content and global alignment of 2 or more nucleotide sequences
    - Computes GC content of multiple nucleotide sequences.
    - Performs global sequence alignment for two or more DNA sequences.
    - Provides visual representation of GC content distribution.

- Feature gc_calc.py for calculating GC content of a single DNA sequence
    - Calculates the GC content of a single DNA sequence.
    - Outputs GC percentage for sequence analysis.
