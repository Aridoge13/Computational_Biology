## Project Features
### Core Functionalities
- DNA/RNA sequence analysis
- Protein sequence characterization
- Sequence alignment and comparison
- Phylogenetic analysis
- Variant annotation
- Metagenomic analysis


## Available Scripts
1. codon_analysis.py: Codon usage analysis and visualization.

2. dna-protein.py: DNA to protein translation in all reading frames.

3. gc_calc.py: GC content calculation.

4. gc_calc_pwa.py: GC content with pairwise alignment.

5. phylogenetic_analysis.py: Phylogenetic tree construction.

6. promoter_id.py: Promoter motif identification.

7. protein_property.py: Protein physicochemical property calculation.

8. protein_seq_motif.py: Protein motif identification 

9. rna_analysis.py: RNA-Seq data analysis and visualization

10. seq_align_score_calc.py: Sequence alignment using Needleman-Wunsch/Smith-Waterman.

11. variant_annotation.py: Variant calling and annotation

12. metagenomic.py: Metagenomic analysis pipeline

13. adhesion_metabolism_crosstalk.py: Pathway analysis between desmosomal genes and metabolic regulators
