## 📘 Description
This repository provides a curated set of Python-based tools for key tasks in computational biology, with a focus on genomics, transcriptomics, and evolutionary analysis. The scripts are modular, well-documented, and easily extendable for applications in:

- Variant annotation
- Sequence comparison
- RNA-seq data analysis
- Phylogenetics
- Regulatory element detection
- Metagenomic profiling

Originally developed to support graduate-level research, this toolkit is suitable for researchers and students working across diverse biological datasets — from mammalian genomes to microbial communities.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

- Supports standard file formats (FASTA, VCF, GTF, etc.)
- Minimal dependencies and lightweight structure
- Suitable for both exploration and automation
- Great for teaching and rapid prototyping of pipelines

## 🧪 Project Features
### Core Functionalities

- **DNA/RNA sequence analysis**: Translate, compare, and characterize raw nucleotide sequences  
- **Regulatory motif detection**: Identify promoter motifs or codon usage patterns  
- **Phylogenetic modeling**: Construct and analyze evolutionary trees  
- **Mutation & variant annotation**: Detect and annotate clustered or somatic mutations  
- **RNA-seq data processing**: Visualize expression and functional divergence  
- **Metagenomic analysis**: Profile community-wide diversity and function

### Workflow Overview
> The tools in this repository are designed to be modular, but can also be used in sequence as part of a complete analysis workflow. Below is an example of how these components may integrate in a mutation- or expression-driven research pipeline:
